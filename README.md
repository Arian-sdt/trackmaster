# Project: Feature and Bug Tracker

## Overview

This C++ console application was designed and developed to track software features and bugs. The project utilizes an in-house **Binary Fixed Length Record** file system to serve as the database, ensuring efficient data management and quick retrieval of stored information. The goal of this project was to create a reliable, user-friendly tool for tracking the progress of software development and bug fixes.

## Features

- **Binary Fixed Length Record File System**: Efficient storage and retrieval of features and bugs.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Simple console-based interaction for ease of use.
- **Tracking Capabilities**: Manage software features and bug reports, providing updates on status and priority.
- **Reliable Data Management**: Ensures that data integrity is maintained across multiple sessions.
  
## Project Documentation

The following documents were created to support this project:

- **Requirement Specifications**: Details the features and functionalities of the application, including both functional and non-functional requirements.
- **User Manual**: A step-by-step guide for users, explaining how to set up and operate the application.
- **Architectural Design**: Describes the system architecture, including the data model, file system structure, and class designs.

## Development Process

The project was developed collaboratively with version control and code management handled through **GitHub**. Best practices for version control were followed, ensuring:

- Code integrity through proper branching and merging processes.
- Efficient collaboration between team members.

## Testing

To ensure the application met all the outlined requirements, **Black Box Testing** was conducted:

- Verified each feature operates as expected without knowledge of the internal code structure.
- Ensured the application is robust and free of critical bugs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/feature-bug-tracker.git
    ```
2. Compile and run the application using the provided makefile 

    For example, using `g++`:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. Follow the User Manual for detailed instructions on using the application.
